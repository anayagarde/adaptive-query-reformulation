# Adaptive Query Reformation

This project builds an end-to-end NLP pipeline that takes a user query, checks if it is **strong** or **weak**, and then decides how much help the query needs.

- **Weak query** → fetch related terms from Google Trends and rewrite the query with a T5 model.  
- **Strong query** → show that it is strong and keep it as is (no extra rewriting for now).

Everything runs in a **Streamlit** web app.

```
streamlit run app.py
```
or 
```
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

## 1. Overall flow

1. The user types a query in the Streamlit app (`app.py`).
2. A **DistilRoBERTa classifier** (`infer.py`) labels the query as `WEAK` or `STRONG`.
3. If the query is **WEAK**:
   - `get_context_from_api.py` / `Trends.py` call **SerpApi Google Trends**.
   - The “top related” queries become context keywords.
   - These keywords are passed to a **T5 query rewriter**, which generates clearer, more specific versions of the query.
   - The UI shows a red “Weak query” card and the rewritten questions.
4. If the query is **STRONG**:
   - The UI shows a green “Strong query” card.
   - The query is treated as already well-formed (no extra rewriting in the current version).
